  description: |
    Binti has developed and implemented a modern bi-directional API to
    share data with your previous deployed systems.  Binti's API is
    HTTPS-based, utilizes JSON, and is organized around Representational
    State Transfer (REST).

    For a smooth transition and integration with your previous system,
    Binti will work with your agency during the launch process to import
    historic licensing data into Binti initially, and configure the API for
    ongoing data integration. This would allow the platform to integrate
    key data fields with that system on an ongoing basis as needed.

    Please contact your agency's account manager with any questions about
    Binti's API.
